First we have to create a nextjs project by using this command
npx create-next-app@latest

then add the project name as per your choice
ProjectName="Clinic"

use this command to start the portal
```bash
npm run dev

This starts your Next.js appâ€™s "development server" on port 3000.


when the nextjs project install completely then we have ready to create website
and Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

after that we  have create a function for components according to our design and render it in the index.js for seeing the result and we can also add api for transfer the data from the server to mysql database table this is creating for only form element that are created in our project

we can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js.The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
